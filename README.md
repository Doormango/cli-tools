# CLI Tools

Born of a desire for utmost convenience, these small command-line tools, mostly written in Python 3, aid with common tasks that I perform, including retrieving audio from YouTube, editing and merging PDF files, making and converting internet shortcuts for Ubuntu / Windows, and more. As the need arises, I will certainly be expanding my collection of scripts, and new additions will be added. Some functionality of certain scripts is really nothing but a wrapper for an underlying command-line utility, such as qpdf or sox; in such cases, the script is designed to simplify the syntax and use of these tools for certain highly specific applications, as needed.
